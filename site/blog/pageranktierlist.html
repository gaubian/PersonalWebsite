<p>Super Smash Bros Ultimate is a game available on Nintendo Switch, in which players can choose characters from various video-games and have them fight. While designed as a party game, playable by up to 8 players simultaneously, it is also played competitively, mostly in 1 vs 1 situations.</p>
<p>As there are more than eighty available characters, each having unique characteristics, the game cannot be perfectly balanced, and some are better than others. From a pure competitive point of view, playing the best character could give an important edge, even though ‘being better’ is a complex notion depending on the players etc. This is why establishing a ranking of characters is a recurrent topic in the smash scene, especially since it is so subjective.</p>
<p>One reason for this subjectivity also was the lack of extensive data. This was up until, in August 2020, u/Adewotta <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/if65cc/win_rates_and_other_data_from_over_600000/">wrote on reddit</a> a blog post</p>
