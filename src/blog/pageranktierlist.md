# Background and context

Super Smash Bros Ultimate is a game available on Nintendo Switch, in which players can choose characters from various video-games and have them fight. While designed as a party game, playable by up to 8 players simultaneously, it is also played competitively, mostly in 1 vs 1 situations.

As there are more than eighty available characters, each having unique characteristics, the game cannot be perfectly balanced, and some are better than others. From a pure competitive point of view, playing the best character could give an important edge, even though 'being better' is a complex notion depending on the players etc. This is why establishing a ranking of characters is a recurrent topic in the smash scene, especially since it is so subjective.

One reason for this subjectivity also was the lack of extensive data. This was up until, in August 2020, u/Adewotta [wrote on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/if65cc/win_rates_and_other_data_from_over_600000/) a blog post
