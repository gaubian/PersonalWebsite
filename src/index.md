# Who am I ?

A PhD student in the [TALGO team](http://www.di.ens.fr/TalgoTeam.html.fr) at École Normale Supérieure, in Paris. I'm mainly interested in graph theory, optimization and algorithmics, especially algorithmic contests.

# Why are you here ?

## Research

My research interests revolve around graph theory, in particular directed graph. I focus on digraph coloring, a notion which arised lately and consists in partitionning directed graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs.

## Teaching

I am a teaching fellow at Paris University. See [here](teaching.html) for any information.

## Algorithmic Contests

If you want any information about algorithmic contests, in particular for the organization of ENS Paris-Saclay's algorithmic club, go [here](algorithmics.html).

## Blogging

Sometimes, I have interesting things to say, and that happens [here](blog/).
